There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed.

Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. Read replicas are used for improved read performance. You can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance. Using a cross-Region read replica can also help ensure that you get back up and running if you experience a regional availability issue in case of a disaster.

When you provision an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Think of multi-AZ deployment as enhancing the availability and reliability of your system. For a disaster event based on disruption or loss of one physical data center, implementing a highly available workload in multiple Availability Zones within a single AWS Region helps mitigate against natural and technical disasters. So, RDS Multi-AZ can be used to address DR requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Amazon RDS Multi-AZ with two readable standbys maximizes read-performance and scalability.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) disaster recovery capabilities in more detail, you can refer to this excellent AWS blog:\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use read replicas for improved read performance only and multi-AZ deployment for disaster recovery only</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use read replicas for disaster recovery only and multi-AZ deployment for improved read performance only</strong></p>\n\n<p>These two options contradict the details provided earlier in the explanation, so these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use both read replicas and multi-AZ deployment having single standby for improved read performance</strong> - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ with single standby can only be used to enhance durability and availability.

There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. There is no need for a long-term purchasing commitment.

Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not the right choice for short-term workloads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS.

Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses.

As a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.

Generally, two Regions are used. Each Region hosts a highly available, multi-Availability Zone (AZ) workload stack. In each Region, data is replicated live between the data stores and also backed up. This protects against disasters that include data deletion or corruption since the data backup can be restored to the last known good state. Each regional stack serves production traffic effectively. But, this strategy is cost involving and should only be used for mission-critical applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot Light strategy</strong> - Pilot Light, like  Warm Standby strategy, replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables. But, the DR Region in a pilot light strategy (unlike warm standby) cannot serve requests until additional steps are taken. A pilot light in a home furnace does not provide heat to the home. It provides a quick way to light the furnace burners that then provide heat.</p>\n\n<p>Warm standby can handle traffic at reduced levels immediately. Pilot light requires you to first deploy infrastructure and then scale out resources before the workload can handle requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backup &amp; Restore strategy</strong> - Backup and Restore is associated with higher RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective). This results in longer downtimes and greater loss of data between when the disaster event occurs and recovery.
