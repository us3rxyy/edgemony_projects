A Reserved Instance (RI) is not a physical instance, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. A reserved instance (RI) cannot be interrupted. So this is the correct option.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q8-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 On-Demand Instance</strong> - An EC2 On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as Reserved instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 Spot Instance</strong> - An EC2 Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 Dedicated Host</strong> - An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host allows you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. It is not cost-efficient compared to an On-Demand instance. So this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n",

Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at the hardware level. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances. You cannot use Dedicated Instances for using server-bound software licenses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - A Reserved Instance (RI) provides you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. A Reserved Instance (RI) is not a physical instance, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of an On-Demand Instance in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. You cannot use a Reserved Instance (RI) for using server-bound software licenses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instance</strong> - An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted.

Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. VPC Endpoint cannot be used to privately connect on-premises data center to AWS Cloud.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Internet Gateway</strong> - An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances. Internet Gateway cannot be used to privately connect on-premises data center to AWS Cloud.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Site-to-Site VPN</strong> - AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between your data center or branch office and your AWS cloud resources.

In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deploy the database via AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - You cannot deploy only a database via Elastic Beanstalk as its meant for automatic application deployment when you upload your code. Then Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Hence this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure the database in RDS read replica mode with automatic failover to the standby</strong> - For RDS, Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. There is no standby available while using read replicas. In case of infrastructure failure, you have to manually promote the read replica to be its own standalone DB Instance, which means that the database endpoint would change. Therefore, this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision the database via AWS CloudFormation</strong> - You can provision the database via CloudFormation for sure, however, it does not provide any automatic recovery in case of a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n",

For each account that you want to make standalone, you must accept the AWS Customer Agreement, choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method.

Over-provisioning resources can lead to unnecessary infrastructure costs, and under-provisioning resources can lead to poor application performance. Compute Optimizer helps you choose optimal configurations for three types of AWS resources: Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and AWS Lambda functions, based on your utilization data.</p>\n\n<p>Compute Optimizer recommends up to 3 options from 140+ EC2 instance types, as well as a wide range of EBS volume and Lambda function configuration options, to right-size your workloads. Compute Optimizer also projects what the CPU utilization, memory utilization, and run time of your workload would have been on recommended AWS resource options. This helps you understand how your workload would have performed on the recommended options before implementing the recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>How Compute Optimizer works:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q46-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/\">https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Systems Manager</strong> - AWS Systems Manager is the operations hub for AWS. Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can track and resolve operational issues across your AWS applications and resources from a central place. With Systems Manager, you can automate operational tasks for Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS instances. You can also group resources by application, view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting, implement pre-approved change workflows, and audit operational changes for your groups of resources. Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easier to operate and manage your infrastructure at scale. Systems Manager cannot be used to identify the optimal resource configuration for workloads running on AWS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets allows you to set custom budgets to track your cost and usage from the simplest to the most complex use cases. With AWS Budgets, you can choose to be alerted by email or SNS notification when actual or forecasted cost and usage exceed your budget threshold, or when your actual RI and Savings Plans' utilization or coverage drops below your desired threshold. With AWS Budget Actions, you can also configure specific actions to respond to cost and usage status in your accounts, so that if your cost or usage exceeds or is forecasted to exceed your threshold, actions can be executed automatically or with your approval to reduce unintentional over-spending.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong> - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. Cost Explorer Resource Rightsizing Recommendations and Compute Optimizer use the same recommendation engine. The Compute Optimizer recommendation engine delivers recommendations to help customers identify optimal EC2 instance types for their workloads. The Cost Explorer console and API surface a subset of these recommendations that may lead to cost savings, and augments them with customer-specific cost and savings information (e.g. billing information, available credits, RI, and Savings Plans) to help Cost Management owners quickly identify savings opportunities through infrastructure rightsizing. Compute Optimizer console and its API delivers all recommendations regardless of the cost implications.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/\">https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/</a></p>\n",

The AWS encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library that is separate from the language–specific SDKs. You can use this encryption library to more easily implement encryption best practices in Amazon S3. Unlike the Amazon S3 encryption clients in the language–specific AWS SDKs, the AWS encryption SDK is not tied to Amazon S3 and can be used to encrypt or decrypt data to be stored anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)</strong> - When you use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a root key that it regularly rotates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS)</strong> - Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits and charges for using this service. There are separate permissions for the use of a KMS key that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your KMS key was used and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. Hence, server-side encryption is not the right answer for the current scenario. So both these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Encryption is enabled by default for all the objects written to Amazon S3. Additional configuration is not required</strong> - Although it's correct that encryption is enabled by default for all the objects written to Amazon S3, however, the given use case mandates that data be encrypted before sending it to Amazon S3, which cannot be accomplished with the given option. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html</a></p>\n",

You can use Elastic Load Balancing to manage incoming requests by optimally routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed. Your load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your application.

With Enterprise Support, you get 24x7 technical support from high-quality engineers, tools and technology to automatically manage the health of your environment, consultative architectural guidance delivered in the context of your applications and use-cases, and a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) to coordinate access to proactive/preventative programs and AWS subject matter experts. You get access to guidance, configuration, and troubleshooting of AWS interoperability with many common operating systems, platforms, and application stack components.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Business Support</strong></p>\n\n<p>You should use AWS Business Support if you have production workloads on AWS and want 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support and architectural guidance in the context of your specific use-cases. You get full access to AWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks. You get access to guidance, configuration, and troubleshooting of AWS interoperability with many common operating systems, platforms, and application stack components.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please review the differences between the AWS Developer Support, AWS Business Support, AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support and AWS Enterprise Support plans as you can expect at least a couple of questions on the exam:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q65-i1.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q65-i2.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q65-i3.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Basic Support</strong> - The AWS Basic Support only provides access to the following:</p>\n\n<p>Customer Service &amp; Communities - 24x7 access to customer service, documentation, whitepapers, and support forums. AWS Trusted Advisor - Access to the core Trusted Advisor checks and guidance to provision your resources following best practices to increase performance and improve security. AWS Health - Your Account Health Dashboard : A personalized view of the health of your AWS services, and alerts when your resources are impacted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Developer Support</strong> - You should use AWS Developer Support plan if you are testing or doing early development on AWS and want the ability to get email-based technical support during business hours. This plan also supports general guidance on how services can be used for various use cases, workloads, or applications. You do not get access to Infrastructure Event Management with this plan.</p>\n\n<p>Both these plans do not support access to guidance, configuration, and troubleshooting of AWS interoperability with third-party software.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Corporate Support</strong> - This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/</a></p>\n",
