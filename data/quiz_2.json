It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. Examples - Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.</p>\n\n<p>PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. Examples - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft).</p>\n\n<p>SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. Examples - Amazon Rekognition, Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom.</p>\n\n<p>Overview of Cloud Computing Types:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q1-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can use Amazon Rekognition to add image and video analysis to your applications using proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology that requires no machine learning expertise.

You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q31-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instance (RI) provides you with significant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. You will be charged for the entire duration, irrespective of your usage. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spot Instance</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host allows you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. A Dedicated Host is not cost-efficient compared to an On-Demand instance.

To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Amazon Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Route 53 Routing Policy Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q51-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Failover routing</strong> - This routing policy is used when you want to configure active-passive failover.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weighted routing</strong> - This routing policy is used to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Simple routing</strong> - With simple routing, you typically route traffic to a single resource, for example, to a web server for your website.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html</a></p>\n","answers":["<p>Simple routing</p>","<p>Failover routing</p>","<p>Weighted routing</p>","<p>Latency-based routing</p>"]},"correct_response":["d"],"section":"Technology","question_plain":"Which Amazon Route 53 routing policy would you use to improve the performance for your customers by routing the requests to the AWS endpoint that provides the fastest experience?","related_lectures":[]},{"_class":"assessment","id":67032270,"assessment_type":"multiple-choice","prompt":{"question":"<p>Which of the following statement is correct for a Security Group and a Network Access Control List (Network ACL)?</p>\n","relatedLectureIds":"","feedbacks":["","","",""],"explanation":"<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security Group acts as a firewall at the instance level whereas Network Access Control List (Network ACL) acts as a firewall at the subnet level</strong></p>\n\n<p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
